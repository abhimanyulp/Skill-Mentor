# Skill mentor 


This project entails the development of a web-based appointment booking system tailored for a tutor. The system will empower users to seamlessly schedule appointments, access their booking history, and exercise control over their personal profiles. For administrative users, comprehensive functionalities will be provided, including the ability to oversee appointments, analyze appointment-related data, and effectively manage both user and teacher accounts.
